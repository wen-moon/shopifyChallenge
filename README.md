2. Answer to __*If you were to open a Shopify store, what would you sell and why*__
 > *If I were to open a Shopify store, I wish to offer both physical products and unique experiences.*
 > 
 > __*Shop Name:  Cookiet*__ 🍱
 > 
 >  __Products:__ We sell unique and continuously updated recipes and the corresponding prepared raw materials for cooking. 
 >  We are combining and integrating the business lines of culinary knowledge sharing, raw material selling, and kitchen supplements selling.
 >  
 >  __Rationales:__ I love cooking, and I have interviewed many of my friends and families about this topic. Cooking is mostly an enjoyable, curing, and rewarding experience. During the pandemic, especially, cooking at home becomes a more stable, more reliable, and more hygienic source of cuisines. My shop __Cookiet__ helps people to create their own experience of dining at home. We will develop new recipes frequently and pair them with the corresponding neatly prepared raw materials. One recipe includes not just the steps of cooking, but also other details that upgrades your eating experience. For each kind of food, we will recommend suitable environmental elements, such as tablewares, lights, and background music. Rather than a material supplier, we are more like a service provider.

3. Some Ideas:
> Introducing social media indentity and functions to e-commerce platforms.
> 
> Many social media platforms have integrated shopping features, including direct links to the shopping website, soft advertisement in the user-generated content, etc. These are super efficient, because the platforms (such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and (in China) Douyin, Little Red Book) have accumulated a mass amount of active users. People are willing to spend so much time on these platforms because of more and more UGCs of high quality and the poweful algorithms. By sharing their own stories and experiences, users are attracting and connecting to more and new users, forming a community with high viscosity and connectivity. I am trying to think the problem the other around. If we introduce the social media features to e-commerce platforms, such as expanding the comment area to a UGC community, it can be a way to make more users to spend more time browsing and create more needs.
